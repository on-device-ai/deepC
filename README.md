## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Using deepC

Here are few of many ways.

1. Try deepC with [Colab Noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EKgQcMCHr-0OsG9qJ4wXv7J4JFlPY7CK)
1. Install it on Ubuntu, raspbian (or any other debian derivatives) using ```pip install deepC```
1. Compile onnx model- [read this article](test/compiler/mnist/README.md) or [watch this video](https://youtu.be/BpFs83MU3HM)
1. Use deepC with a [Docker File](Dockerfile)

See more examples in [tutorial](tutorials/README.md) dir.

## üìõ what is deepC?

deepC library, compiler and inference framework is designed to **enable and perform** deep learning neural networks by focussing on features of small form-factor devices like micro-controllers, eFPGAs, cpus and other embedded devices like [raspberry-pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [odroid](https://www.hardkernel.com/), [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [SparkFun Edge](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170), [risc-V](https://www.amazon.com/Seeed-Studio-Sipeed-Maixduino-RISC-V/dp/B07SW9ZWQQ), mobile phones, x86 and arm laptops among others.

![edge Devices](misc/edgeDevices.png "supported edge devices")

deepC also offers ahead of time compiler producing optimized executable based on [LLVM compiler tool chain](https://llvm.org/) specialized for deep neural networks with [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) as front end.

## üìù Design

Main components of **deepC** have been designed to represent and optimize the common deep learning networks in high level graph IR and to transform the computation graph to minimize memory utilization, optimize data layout and fuse computation patterns for different hardware backends.

## üíª Development

Build and start modifying deepC locally from source code with following steps

### ‚≠ï Ubuntu 18.04

Follow the steps to install pre-requisites
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3.6-dev python3-pip swig doxygen clang-format clang clang-8 llvm-8 llvm-8-dev protobuf-compiler libprotoc-dev
sudo pip3 install numpy==1.15.0 onnx==1.5.0
```

Once you are done, build deepC
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-techsystems/deepC.git
cd deepC
make
```
### ‚≠ï Mac OS / Windows 10

Make sure you have the below pre-requisites
#### Mac OS:
- [Python for Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)

#### Windows 10:
- [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows)

Once you are done, build deepC inside docker container

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why compiler‚ùî
deepC is targeted towards devices with small formfactor like microcontrollers, which are part of all sorts of household devices: think appliances, cars, and toys. In fact, there are around 30 billion microcontroller-powered devices produced each year. They're cheap, require very little energy, and are very reliable.

By bringing deep learning models to tiny microcontrollers, we can boost the intelligence of billions of devices that we use in our lives, without relying on expensive hardware or reliable internet connections. Imagine smart appliances that can adapt to your daily routine, intelligent industrial sensors that understand the difference between problems and normal operation, and magical toys that can help kids learn in fun and delightful ways.
